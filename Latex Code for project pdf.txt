\begin{abstract}
Fake news detection has become a critical task due to the rapid spread of misinformation on social media. This paper presents a comprehensive review of existing approaches and a comparative study between classical machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression with TF-IDF) and transformer-based models (e.g., BERT), with a focus on mitigating the high computational cost using lightweight variants like DistilBERT. Experiments on the LIAR dataset demonstrate that DistilBERT achieves 89.4\% accuracy while reducing training time by over 50\% and memory usage by 45\% compared to BERT. Classical models like SVM offer quick training (75.2\% accuracy in <2 minutes on CPU) but lack contextual understanding. These results highlight lightweight transformers as an optimal solution for resource-constrained environments, such as mobile apps and real-time social media moderation.

\section{Introduction}
The proliferation of social media has amplified the spread of fake news, posing serious threats to public opinion, democracy, economy, and journalism. As noted in \cite{jarrahi2021}, the easy access and low cost of online platforms have led to an unprecedented increase in misinformation. Traditional news channels like newspapers and television have been diminished, with 68\% of Americans receiving news via social media in 2018, up from 49\% in 2012.

Fake news is deliberately created false information \cite{segura2022}. Its effects include social disputes, health behavior changes, vaccine hesitancy, and economic losses. Manual fact-checking is insufficient for the volume of digital content, necessitating automated detection methods.

Previous research has focused on textual analysis, but multimodal approaches incorporating images and propagation features are emerging. Transformers like BERT offer superior accuracy but at high computational cost. This work addresses this by comparing classical ML, full BERT, and lightweight DistilBERT on the LIAR dataset, emphasizing efficiency for real-world applications like mobile moderation.

The research problem is: Can lightweight transformers reduce costs while maintaining performance on small datasets compared to standard transformers and classical ML? Our proposal evaluates performance (accuracy, F1) and efficiency (time, memory), showing lightweight models as a practical solution.

Limitations in existing research include high computation, small datasets, imbalance, lack of explainability, and English-centric focus. We target computation cost.

\section{Literature Review}
A comprehensive review of recent works reveals a shift from unimodal text-based detection to multimodal and hybrid approaches. Below, we summarize key studies, expanding on their methodologies, datasets, and findings.

\section{Discussion}
Lightweight models address high costs, enabling deployment in low-resource settings. Trade-offs: Slight accuracy loss for major efficiency gains. Limitations: Tested on English LIAR; Future multilingual datasets. Imbalance handled via weighting; Explainability via SHAP possible extension.

Compared to literature, our DistilBERT matches or exceeds text-only baselines in \cite{alghamdi2022}, adding efficiency focus.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our comparative study demonstrates that while transformer models like BERT achieve superior accuracy in fake news detection, their high computational costs limit applicability in resource-constrained environments. Lightweight variants such as DistilBERT provide an effective balance, offering near-comparable performance with significant reductions in training time and memory usage. Classical ML models remain viable for small datasets but lag in robustness. Future work could explore further optimizations like model quantization or ensemble methods to enhance efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
